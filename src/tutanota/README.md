# Tutanota

## Programming task 1

```text
You shall implement a very simple browser application in Javascript that shall allow a user to check if an entered URL exists. The user shall be able to enter an URL and the URL must then be checked for valid format and if the format is correct it shall be sent to a server which provides the information if the URL exits and if it is a file or a folder. You shall not implement the server side, but just mock it on the client. The server call shall be asynchronous.
The check for the URL format and the existence check shall be triggered as the user is typing, but the existence check shall be throttled to avoid that too many server requests are done all the time.

We are looking forward to see how you approach and solve this task. We don't think it should take more than 2 or 3 hours.
```

### Solution

This is what I have created in 3 hours.

## Programming task 2

```text
We now would like you to solve another task to get a better impression of your programming skills: Please write a small application in JavaScript that allows detecting spam emails by similarity of the email body text.
The background to this is that spammers usually send similar emails to a large number of recipients, but to avoid being detected as spammers they often change small parts of that email when sent to different recipients.
Let's assume we want to detect Tutanota users sending out spam and we can read their emails. Your task is to write a routine that gets a set of email body texts and assigns a spam probability to each of them depending on the similarity to the other emails in the set. The more similar it is to the other emails, the more likely it is a spam email.

We are looking forward to your solution!
